# March Madness Bracket Predictor

## Description

There has never officially been a perfect NCAA March Madness bracket. With the raw odds about one in 9.2 quintillion, why not let a machine decide for you?

This program will determine the winners of each matchup all the way through the finals. This uses team average data for offensive rebounding, three point shooting percentage, free throw percentage, and turnovers on both offense and defense to determine a score that will be put up against the opposing team.

## Installation

This assumes you have python already installed along with numpy and pandas libraries.

All you need to do is download both the python file and the data file into your project folder. 

## Usage

Run the python file, and it will output the winner of each matchup will be posted on a new line for each round. Example output below:
